# Automation-using-Google-assistant
Google assistant is an AI powered assistant. In this project, using MQTT and API keys, we have programmed the Arduino and connected it to IFTTT that connects the Google assistant with Adafruit IO. When the command "Lights ON" is given to the Google assistant, the working Adafruit dashboard shows a change in value, and the Google assistant returns a message saying "The lights are on". Similarly, when the command "Lights OFF" is given to the Google assistant, the working Adafruit dashboard shows a change in value, and the Google assistant returns a message saying "The lights are off". Both these replies to the voice/command Lights ON/OFF are pre-customised in the IFTTT applet. 
The Arduino is essenially connected to house lighting system, but for simplicity of testing, we consider an LED connection at first. When the command is now given to the Google Assistant, along with the MQTT dashboard value changing, the LED also glows or turns off depending on the command.
